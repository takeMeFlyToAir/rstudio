# This script creates a directory (hunspell_dictionaries) that contains the 
# latest hunspell dictionaries (and dic_delta files) from chromium. It also
# builds two archives (english-dictionaries.zip and all-dictionaries.zip) 
# that can be used as the basis for rstudio dictionaries. Note that after 
# this script is run by RStudio we upload the files to S3 for subsequent 
# download to dependencies/common/hunspell_dictionaries as part of the 
# install-dependencies script
