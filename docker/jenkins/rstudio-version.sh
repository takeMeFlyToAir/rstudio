# rstudio-version.sh
#
# This script reads, and updates, official RStudio build numbers, based on
# information stored in S3 and observed in the local repository.
#
# The rules observed are as follows:
# 
# 1. Every build of the open source version of RStudio results in a new patch release
#    formatted as:
#
#    major.minor.patch
# 
#    On S3, the file 'oss-patch.csv' contains a list of open source commits and
#    their associated patch versions, both as a baseline for determining future
#    patch versions and so that subsequent Pro builds can determine their
#    derivative versions.
#
# 2. The build number of RStudio Pro is formatted as follows:
#
#    major.minor.patch-suffix
#
#    where "major.minor.patch" is the version of RStudio Open Source from which
#    the Pro repo is derived, and "suffix" is the number of builds of Pro that
#    have been made based on the associated open source version.
#
# The script is typically used by the build script to bump the build versions,
# but it can also be invoked manually. Pass "debug" as the last parameter to
# see what the script would do (in this mode debug output is written and no
# changes are saved to S3).

# abort on error
