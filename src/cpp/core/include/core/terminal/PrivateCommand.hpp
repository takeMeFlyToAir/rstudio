/*
 * The PrivateCommand class is used by terminal to silently run a command in the terminal
 * without the user seeing the input or output. It only runs if the terminal has no child
 * processes and if the user doesn't seem to be in the middle of typing a command.
 *
 * Relies on HISTCONTROL=ignorespace to prevent the "hidden" command from being added to
 * shell history. RStudio sets this when launching terminal, but shell config can change it.
 * If the command sees that HISTCONTROL is not set to ignorespace (or ignoreboth)
 * it will stop firing any more commands for duration of this object, otherwise users will see a
 * "weird" thing in history after virtually every command they type.
 *
 * Host must frequently call onTryCapture() to possibly fire the command, userInput() so
 * PrivateCommand can analyze if user has entered a command or is potentially in the middle of
 * typing a command, and output() to let PrivateCommand analyze output from a private command
 * it issued so it capture it and end the private-command mode.
 *
 * If oncePerUserCommand is true, the private command will only run after the user has hit
 * <enter>, so has potentially run a command. It will not run again until user has hit
 * <enter> again. Idea here is to only capture changes that can be made by a user command, such
 * as changing the environment.
 *
 * If oncePerUserCommand is false, then the private command can run as often as every
 * privateCommandTimeoutMs.
 *
 * Once PrivateCommand::hasCaptured() returns false, the output of the private command is available
 * via getPrivateOutput().
 *
 * Capture mode stays enabled briefly after the expected output has been received so it can
 * suppress the prompt that is displayed after the hidden command is executed. Sometimes
 * this prompt arrives in the same output string as the end of the input, but sometimes it
 * doesn't and user would see a mysterious extra prompt.
