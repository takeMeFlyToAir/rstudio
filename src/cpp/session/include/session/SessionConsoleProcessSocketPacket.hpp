 * Super-simple packet format for Terminal Websocket payloads. Not using JSON to keep
 * overhead to absolute minimum, and to make server-side parsing trivial on a worker
 * thread.
 *
 * First character is a method indicator, as follows:
 *    "a" = send text, e.g. "aHello"
 *    "b" = ping/pong, e.g. "b"
 *
 * Only the "send text" method has a payload (everything after the "a").
 *
 * See TerminalSocketPacket in Java code for client-side of this.
