 HttpConnection plays two related roles in the system:

   1) It is a sink for asynchronous reading of http requests by
      HttpConnectionListener (this interface is private to HttpConnectionListener
      via friendship). This role occurs on a background thread.

   2) It provides an interface for HttpConnection::Handler to respond to
      requests. Responses are sent synchronously and are threfore disconnected
      from the HttpConnectionListener io_service and (most importantly) can
      therefore be sent on background threads.
