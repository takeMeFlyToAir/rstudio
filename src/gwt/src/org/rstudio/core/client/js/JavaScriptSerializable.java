/*
 * JavaScriptSerializable is an annotation that may be placed on any class to
 * make it possible to both serialize the class to a JavaScriptObject and to
 * deserialize the JavaScriptObject into a new instance of the class.
 * 
 * There are a few prerequisites that must be met for classes that wish to be
 * serialized:
 * 
 * 1. The class must contain only fields which are "plain old data" (e.g.
 *    String, int, boolean, JavaScriptObject), or classes which are themselves 
 *    JavaScriptSerializable The behavior for other fields is not currently
 *    defined; these fields may be null on hydration.
 *    
 * 2. The class must have an empty constructor; the deserializer works by 
 *    constructing an empty instance of the class and then using JSNI to 
 *    populate its fields.
 * 
 * See remarks in JavaScriptSerializer for notes on how to serialize and 
 * deserialize annotated classes, and example usage.
