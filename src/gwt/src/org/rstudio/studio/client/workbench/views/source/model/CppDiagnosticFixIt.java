/**
 * Fix-its are described in terms of a source range whose contents
 * should be replaced by a string. This approach generalizes over
 * three kinds of operations: removal of source code (the range covers
 * the code to be removed and the replacement string is empty),
 * replacement of source code (the range covers the code to be
 * replaced and the replacement string provides the new code), and
 * insertion (both the start and end of the range point at the
 * insertion location, and the replacement string provides the text to
 * insert).
 *
 * Note that source ranges are half-open ranges [a, b), so the source 
 * code should be replaced from a and up to (but not including) b.
